[![](https://readthedocs.org/projects/gef-scripts/badge/?version=master)](http://gef-scripts.readthedocs.io/en/master/)

## How-to

Open repositories of external scripts for [GDB Enhanced Features (GEF)](https://github.com/hugsy/gef). To use those scripts once `gef` is setup, simply clone this repository and update your GEF settings like this:

```
gefâž¤  gef config gef.extra_plugins_dir /path/to/gef-scripts/directory
```

You can now load manually any script from this repo, or restart GDB to make GEF load them automatically.


## Contributions

This repository is open to anyone, no filtering is done! Simply PR the command you want to share :smile: And useful scripts will eventually be integrated directly to GEF.

Check out [GEF API page](https://gef.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/) to start writing powerful GDB commands using GEF!


## Thanks & enjoy !
